    //! TextInput instances are invisible objects that build a text string from input,
    //! using the current operating system's keyboard layout.
    //! At its most basic form, you only need to create a new TextInput instance and
    //! pass it to your window via setTextInput. Until you call this function again,
    //! passing 0, the TextInput object will build a text that can be accessed via
    //! TextInput::text().
    //! A TextInput object is purely abstract, though; drawing the input field is left
    //! to the user. As with most of Gosu, how this is handled is completely left open.
    //! TextInput only aims to provide enough code for your own GUIs to build upon.
